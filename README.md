# Resources for learning Deep Learning 

Here are some resources for learning Deep Learning as a mediocre programmer.

## The d2l Book

I found it best getting started by reading the [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai) book, which is comprehensible and has enough depth and breadth.

## Math

I met various math concepts in d2l constantly, some were new to me, and some were things I learnt at school but never touched then for more than 10 years. Below are some sites explaining math very well, even make you love math!

- [Math is Fun](https://www.mathsisfun.com)
- [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com)

If you found matrices still too hard to understand, following lecture notes might help you as they helped me.

- [Matrix algebra for beginners](https://vcp.med.harvard.edu/papers/matrices-1.pdf) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240112194052/https://vcp.med.harvard.edu/papers/matrices-1.pdf))
- [Gradients involving matrices](https://web.stanford.edu/class/math114/lecture_notes/gradients_involving_matrices.pdf) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240203013220/https://web.stanford.edu/class/math114/lecture_notes/gradients_involving_matrices.pdf))

## Articles

Many ideas in d2l are hard to understand, which is normal because it tries to explain and implement complex ideas in a short chapter. I struggled to build intuitions for some important ideas and below are some great articles that helped me a lot.

- [Understanding softmax and the negative log-likelihood](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2017/08/13/softmax-and-the-negative-log-likelihood/) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231224030853/https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2017/08/13/softmax-and-the-negative-log-likelihood/))
- [What is torch.nn really?](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20231205022718/https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html))
- [Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20240131082018/https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/))
